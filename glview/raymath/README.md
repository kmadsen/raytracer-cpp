# About

This library is being use to organize the glview project. Also note that the tests are disabled by default, that way it can be compiled faster.

The most common math code is going to move to this library. Then I would like to make similar libaries in Rust or Kotlin native. Learning languages and experimenting with code speed.

Also, I'm not very good at linking C++ libraries. So, I'm learning how to do that around here.

## Build and run

Build and run the tests.
``` sh
mkdir build
cd build
cmake .. -DWITH_TEST=ON
make
ctest
```
